## Writing

I'm an English major. I write. Poorly. Here are some of the things I wrote!

### Fiction, both fan- and otherwise

- [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/users/wornoutplaces)
  - Nothing super profound or interesting on my ao3. You should *definitely* check out [Two Shots a Round/Fifty Rounds a Magazine](https://archiveofourown.org/works/53174449/chapters/134549329), my collaboration with the imitable [buck-yyyy](https://buck-yyyy.tumblr.com/) and definitely the best thing on my Ao3. Yes, he did most of the writing. Go read the rest of his stuff. It's good.
- Fluid
- Short piece I wrote, mostly inspired by William Gibson's *Neuromancer* and the NYT travel section.
- Descent
- First bit of a crime/romance concept I started.
- HAGIOGENESIS
  - To be announced!

### Journalism, Essays, and Letters

### Misc
