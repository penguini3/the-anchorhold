## Writing

I'm an English major. I write. Poorly. Here are some of the things I wrote!

### Fiction, Both Fan- and Otherwise

- [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/users/wornoutplaces)
  - Nothing super profound or interesting on my ao3. You should _definitely_ check out [Two Shots a Round/Fifty Rounds a Magazine](https://archiveofourown.org/works/53174449/chapters/134549329), my collaboration with the imitable [buck-yyyy](https://buck-yyyy.tumblr.com/) and definitely the best thing on my Ao3. Yes, he did most of the writing. Go read the rest of his stuff. It's good.
- [Fluid](/pages/writing/fluid)
  - Short piece I wrote, mostly inspired by William Gibson's _Neuromancer_ and the style of Mavis Gallant. I first found out about her from Wes Anderson's _The French Dispatch_, and I've loved her terse, sure style ever since.
- [Descent](/pages/writing/descent)
  - First bit of a crime/romance concept I started. These bits are a few years old, and I have a second draft that I'll put up later.
- HAGIOGENESIS
  - WIP body horror/sci-fi story about a girl who wants to become a saint.
