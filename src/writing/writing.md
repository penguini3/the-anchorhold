## Writing

I'm an English minor. I write. Poorly. Here are some of the things I wrote!

### Fiction, Both Fan- and Otherwise

- [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/users/wornoutplaces)
  - Nothing super profound or interesting on my ao3. You should _definitely_ check out [Two Shots a Round/Fifty Rounds a Magazine](https://archiveofourown.org/works/53174449/chapters/134549329), my collaboration with the imitable [buck-yyyy](https://buck-yyyy.tumblr.com/) and definitely the best thing on my Ao3. Yes, he did most of the writing. Go read the rest of his stuff. It's good.
- [Fluid](/pages/writing/fluid)
  - Short piece I wrote, mostly inspired by William Gibson's *Neuromancer* and the style of Mavis Gallant. I first found out about her from Wes Anderson's *The French Dispatch*, and I've loved her terse, sure style ever since.
- [Descent](/pages/writing/descent)
  - First bit of a crime/romance concept I started. These bits are a few years old, and I have a second draft that I'll put up later.
- HAGIOGENESIS
  - WIP body horror/sci-fi story about a girl who wants to become a saint, and has to kill what she loves.

### Essays

These are a mix of stuff I wrote for school and personal essays/my thoughts on what-have-yous.

- [Passive Rewilding in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone](/pages/writing/CEZ)
    - One of the better things I've ever written, and one of the more heavily researched essays. I've always been partial to ecofiction and the CEZ, and working on this essay really hammered home my own distaste for humanity. Fuck those guys. **Editors Note: This link will eventually lead to a PDF. For now... sorry.**
- [Machine Gore](/pages/writing/mechdeath)
    - I got anxious and didn't make this one as horny as it deserves. Will fix that, eventually.
