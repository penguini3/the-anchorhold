# Uses

Here are some of the things I use!

## Hardware

**Thinkpad X13 Gen 4 AMD**

My main laptop!! For some reason, I really love to name all of my computers and stuff—this one is named Madeline. She's running CachyOS, initially because I wanted a more simple installation process than the whole affair of installing Arch. Since then, I've gotten a lot more confident with Linux, but a. I still appreciate the performance benefits of CachyOS and b. I just don't need to switch to anything else.

For writing, I mostly use Markdown in Neovim, unless it's for something that requires a specific format for school. If I need to, I use LibreOffice for small assignments and write longer papers in LaTeX, using the TeX Live installation. I do most of my organization/outlining with plain text, too—I've found that the more complex an organizational or planning system is, the more time I spend agonizing over whether I'm using it properly or adhering to the plan than I do either actually planning anything.

In the future, I'd like to swap out the screen for something a little nicer, but that would involve either hunting down one of the 2.8k displays that were available on the Intel models or finding a third party panel that would work. Probably wouldn't be a ton of work, but it's also not really a priority.

**Thinkpad R51**

The priority. Windows XP, currently, although I'm switching her out for an SSD soon. I haven't decided on whether to keep XP or switch her over to Gentoo once the new drive comes in. No name picked out, I'm planning on maxing out the RAM to 2GB, replacing her hard drive with an SSD, and using her as my main writing machine. There's something so charming about old computers, and I'm really, really excited to start working on her.

**Canon Rebel T5**

Good ebay find!! I like taking pictures :3 And, like everyone who likes taking pictures, I don't take anywhere near enough pictures. I really need to start taking my camera with me when I do things.

**Kobo Clara BW**

My e-reader... nothing special about her, but I love having a reader I can keep in my bag. Books get heavy, quick, and I'm usually pretty indecisive about what I'm reading at the moment.

**Google Pixel 10**

Lyudmila, my phone. I'm still weighing the pros and cons of switching her over to GrapheneOS vs the standard PixelOS, but... who knows!! Despite probably being the device I use the most, I'm the least pleased with my phone... I really should think of something fun to do with it.

## Education

**Open Alex**
