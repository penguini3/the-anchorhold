## Welcome to the Anchorhold
  
Welcome to my little home in cyberspace! This is my personal site, and hosts
some of my writing, some reviews, some of my current projects, and an area to
contact me.

Some of my interests include computing, writing, madness, and the intersections of those concepts. See my about page for more! This website is currently a work in progress, so please excuse the mess.
