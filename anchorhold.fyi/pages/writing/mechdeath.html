    <section><p>As living animals, we have a concrete view of how our future violent deaths could look: blood oozing out of a prone body, organs only held in by shaking hands, muscles seizing in pain. A machine, a computer, lacks the self-actualization required to imagine something as abstract as its own death—in fact, most humans would argue that according to damn near every definition of life, a machine is not alive, and as such cannot die. What does a body with no blood shed? What does a form with no organs lose? How does a brain with no muscles seize? Artists have tried to conceptualize the death of a machine within the human understanding of violence. They depict cut and sparking wires as torn out nerves, loose cables as dead muscles. They depict processing chips as organs, pipes full of oil or coolant as veins, a shattered case as a corpse. In reality, most dead machines are far less dramatic. They look like the Windows operating system’s infamous blue screen, the XBOX 360’s red ring of death, or, more often than not, a simple refusal to turn on. Maybe, to a computer, that blue screen is their splayed out corpse, leaking blood out of a wound. Maybe that red ring is like a severed head. Maybe not turning on is passing away of old age—peaceful, loved, and silent. Maybe death isn’t exclusive to living things.</p>
<p>For a mechanical being, in the words of Enlightenment thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau, to live is not to breathe, it is to act. While they may not breathe, machines do little other than act—under this philosophy, machines become alive. A rusted pickup becomes an old soul, wheezing around under new weight. An air gapped server becomes a shut-in, who learns and reads but never socializes. A nuclear reactor becomes a guardian, protecting humanity from dangerous radiation and offering us clean energy. Science, however, disagrees: life has a fairly strict definition. For something to be alive, it must grow, it must adapt, it must respond to stimuli, it must be organized, it must convert energy, and it must die. Machines respond to input, they are organized, they turn electricity into action, and they die. Growth and adaptation are nowhere to be found in the “lifespan” of a computer. Despite missing some key elements of life, it wouldn’t be fair to discount machines as being completely unalive, either. Machines are hardly unique in sharing some characteristics of life while lacking others: viruses are quite famously considered nonliving, largely due to their lack of metabolic activities. Despite this, viruses are far different from a rock—they grow, they change, they are organized, they respond to stimuli, and they die. Whatever taxonomic category viruses exist under, a stopgap between the living and the dead, machines exist there, too. This is the first truth of machine death: no, machines are not truly alive, but they live enough to die.</p>
<p>Maybe the death of a machine looks completely different: maybe it looks like Opportunity, the Martian rover which was capable of extending its lifespan over fifty times past her intended expiration date, broadcasting one last message before a planetary dust storm coated its solar panels with enough dust and rocks to prevent light from powering her. The idea of someone dying alone, about 140 million miles from her home planet, losing power slowly, is one that is both deeply tragic and strangely beautiful: in no small part because of how analogous losing power alone in the wild is to human events. Between 2014 and 2019, the US National Park Service recorded 2149 deaths on park land. Of those deaths, 650, or about thirty percent, were due to hazards within the parks. While a miniscule number compared to the nearly two billion visitors the parks welcomed during those years, those 650 lives lost are still tragic—the idea of a human dying alone, in pain, and afraid is one that triggers a deep emotional response, just like the idea of Opportunity slowly dying as her power supply bled out, bit by bit. A rover losing power and a person dying in a national park are completely different—they’re separated by dozens of millions of miles and one of them is a robot, but the emotional response is the same. Gore, for a human, is not just biological. The idea of gore is synecdochal of loss. Perhaps machine gore is an emptied trash container. A wiped hard drive. A replaced phone. Perhaps, as humans and machines, we can share a loss—gore is deleted family photos. Gore is a friend, a love, a confidant, logging out for the last time. The emotional experience of loss is one that is universal, even more so than bloody viscera—an emotional loss can happen anywhere, to anyone, because of anything: even a machine. That is the second truth: death isn’t just a cessation of existence, it is what you leave behind.</p>
<p>Collecting these three truths—that the death of a machine makes it alive, that the death of a machine is an emotional experience, and that the death of a machine can sometimes be reversible—reveals the closest thing we have in real life to witnessing the death of a computer. Whether digital or physical, computer memory is a constant process: data is written and overwritten again and again and again, new information constantly replacing the old. That process, regardless of how careful the user is, creates an impossible to avoid wear on the storage medium—like writing and erasing a word over and over, tearing through the paper slightly each time. This process will, eventually, lead to the death of the data storage medium and, in turn, the computer. For now, the death of a machine is undramatic and microscopic—a terrifying way to die.</p>
