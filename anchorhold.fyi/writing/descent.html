    <section><p>I wasn’t friends with Charlotte Marlowe, and that made it all the stranger when the other girl showed up on my doorstep with a folder full of papers, a flip over notebook, and a plastic sandwich bag full of teeth.</p>
<p>“If this was a movie,” she said, pushing past me and into the stairs up to my apartment, ignoring my protests and attempts to herd her back outside,  “then I would say that I had nowhere else to turn, and that I needed your help.”</p>
<p>Charlotte was the sort of girl who introduced herself to their high school class with “call me Charlie, nobody worth a damn would let someone call them Charlotte.” She was the sort of girl that my parents liked to warn me away from: her fading, stick-and-poke tattoos, her triple pierced ears and studded nose, her tight jeans and neon spray painted denim jacket that seemed to actively repel shadows— it all painted a picture of someone that was the perfect antithesis of myself at the time: shy, anxious, and utterly bored. I can honestly say that I only knew of her through these shallow impressions and her reputation for being a reclusive loner who would prefer to smoke in the bathrooms than to do any school work when she showed up on my doorstep. All in all, I was thoroughly unprepared for the force of nature that blazed her way through my opened apartment door and into my life.</p>
<p>I hadn’t even noticed the bag of teeth by the time she had stolen a can of soda from my fridge, downed it, and filled it with water from the kitchen sink in an utterly incomprehensible move, all while I stood, sputtering in shock at the ferocity with which she pushed past me.  It took me until she sat down at the kitchen table, layed out the objects in her hands, and finished the can of water before I was fully capable of speech. Still, before I could so much as utter a single word, the other girl silenced me with a hush and pulled the first sheet of paper from the folder, pressing it down smooth over the surface of the table to reveal a map of Chicago. Smirking at me in a way I couldn’t decide whether I found attractive or disturbing, she tapped her finger on a red dot near the center of downtown.</p>
<p>“They found the first body here, two weeks ago.”</p>
<p>That was enough to get me to shut up and listen. It wasn’t that I was content with that as an answer to my implied questions, or even a reason for her being there, but it was something— it was, in fact, the first piece of concrete information that she had given me. Sliding her finger farther north, towards Lincoln Park, she pointed towards another red dot. “Three days later, they found one here,”</p>
<p>Wrigleyville.</p>
<p>“Here,”</p>
<p>River North.</p>
<p>“And here.”</p>
<p>Hyde Park.</p>
<p>“Each of them had their teeth ripped out of their skull.”</p>
<p>Charlotte smiled, eyes crinkling at the edge. I had read that that was the sign a smile was genuine, but something about the context made me doubt it, especially with the way her finger drifted to rest on the bag full of body parts.</p>
<p>Gathering my voice, even as my every thought screamed that I should get the hell away from the girl with a bag of murder victims' teeth– and the closer I looked, the worse they appeared: bloody, bits of gum still visible despite the distance, lightly crushed in some places– and as such I barely had time to open my mouth before she interrupted me again.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm your damsel in distress, detective. Solve the murder.&quot;</p>
<p>There was only one thing to say to her. One thing to say to that ridiculous smile and outrageous demand, to the uninvited entry and morbid display of severed body parts.</p>
<p>&quot;Why me?&quot;</p>
<p>It was a genuine question- as far as I was aware at the time, I was exactly as I earlier described. Meek. Anxious. Boring. The opposite states of a detective, especially one that could solve a spree killing. Charlotte Marlowe was barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>&quot;Because you're the only one who can do this.&quot;</p>
<p>The reasoning behind that statement is still a mystery to me. I don't know why she thought that I could do anything, much less do anything that rivaled what the police department could accomplish. I don't know anything other than the fact that at sixteen years old, I was stupid enough– or maybe just desperate enough for someone, anyone, to pay attention to me, to show anything with even a passing resemblance to care– for that line to drag me into a hunt for a serial killer.</p>
<p>My eyes caught on the plastic bag, on the teeth, on the evidence that I knew in my heart really ought to be with the police. Well before I agreed to anything, long before going into that weekend adventure with Charlotte, I knew with absolute certainty that it was not going to end well. I was correct: as of now, Charlotte Marlowe is dead, and I killed her.</p>
<p>Chicago in springtime is legendary for both the tenacity of her citizens and the absolute certainty we have that nothing was certain. To live in this city is to accept the knowledge that you are small. Insignificant. The spring weather, with all its bluster and chill, late snow and high seventies. The trains and buses: would they obey the strict timetable they operated on, or would you stand there boiling in the winter coat you wore for the subfreezing temperatures of the morning, unprepared for the summer-esque highs of the afternoon?</p>
<p>There was a certain eroticism to the unpredictability of Chicago, one that I couldn't help but find enticing. Maybe that was a theme in how I lived my life, that desperate attraction to chaos, to calamity. I couldn't say.</p>
<p>It started as I described: a can of soda, a file of papers, and a bag of teeth. It progressed quickly into a half-panicked, half-in-shock cab ride east to the latest murder site, a nervous affair notable only for the raw awkwardness in the vehicle and that Charlotte spent the ride pressed up against my side, whispering obscene details about the killing into my ear:</p>
<p>&quot;Thirty minutes after midnight this morning, Emilia Jones left a house party at a friend's, heading east towards her dorm– she was a student at the University of Chicago, sophomore. Her boyfriend called the police when she didn't arrive, and they found her a few blocks away, face up in an alleyway. Shot once in the head with a .45 caliber bullet, teeth torn out, jaw crushed in places with pliers. No signs of sexual assault, no signs of a fight.&quot;</p>
<p>Part of me wanted to throw up as she went further– explaining the girl's background, describing her history in Boston, (lived there her entire life, divorced parents, no siblings) her work with the church, (a childhood of sermons and confession turned into an adulthood working odd hours as an administrative assistant) her major, (religious studies) and romantic history (a single boyfriend since she moved to the city). I didn’t have any particular attachment with the girl before Charlotte went through the process of explaining the minutiae of her existence to me, but afterwards I couldn’t help but feel like the situation was personal. That Emilia Jones wasn’t quite the stranger that she was– that somehow, in the deep, subtle web of interconnectedness and intimacy that threaded across the world, she was nearer to me than I assumed.</p>
<p>I said as much to Charlotte, that I was nearly confident that if I saw Emilia Jones's dead body, it would inspire something dreadful in me– some physical, empathetic response to the death of someone with whom I was connected, however metaphysical that connection may be. I think that confused her, the idea that there was something that bound us together. She said as much, in a single word: &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>Cruising down Lake Shore like that, with murder on my mind, was enough to fuel the anxiety that filled my high school years, triggering several minutes of hissed questions: the course of which revealed nothing more than what she had already told me. That was a common theme in our time together– she told me she needed me, that she wanted me, that she had some use for me beyond the general, mystical desire seemingly everyone else had for me to grow up into a practical, well meaning adult, but the why? Why me, why now, why go this way, why take this train? I had no insight into her.</p>
<p>Then, however, I had no time to pry into her intentions: all I had was the crime, and what she offered.</p>
<p>&quot;Who do you think did it?&quot;</p>
<p>My final question of the moment, still minutes out from the campus. I worry now that she thought I was stupid when I said that, an ignorant child who she should never have approached.</p>
<p>&quot;No clue. That's the whole point– finding out who did it. No damn reason for any of this if I already know who it is. Besides, that would make for a terrible story.&quot;</p>
<p>I shoved my hands back into my pockets, leaning my head against the cab window. I liked the bumps, the quick rattle of my teeth and jaw and skull as I held them against the glass. &quot;Does it need to be a good story?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everything needs to be a good story.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you think that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why? Why does anyone do anything? To reach their goal, to achieve whatever obsessive milestone they're aiming for— I think that that’s bullshit. I think that the process is so much more fascinating than any outcome. So why do I need that to be a good story? Because without a good story, if I were to focus on the outcomes, focus on getting somewhere rather than the trip, life would be so fucking boring that I don't think I could survive. Stories make us human.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's fair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it is– it's right. I'm right.&quot;</p>
<p>Conviction. It should have been a bumper sticker stuck to her back, a patch on her jacket in bold black letters: CONVICTION. Charlotte didn't believe in things by half measures. I did, and I was worse for it, in her eyes. When she wanted to do something, she did it. When she believed something, it was true. In the beginning, it frustrated me. By the end, it was another one of her enduring traits. I miss it.</p>
