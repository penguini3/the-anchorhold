    <section><p>Our city streets: something closer to the interior of an elderly person’s apartment. Someone with too many cats or a penchant for collecting clothes three sizes too big and chairs half a size too small for anyone over the age of eight. Closer to that, that made-up apartment, than any street more than three kilometers east, where the out-of-towners stayed in their weeklong rentals. Me: nineteen, a nihilist in every way but the ones that counted– foolish? Yes. Self absorbed? Definitely. Dead? soon, weeks/days/hours from now. Irrelevant for now. New Boston: not San Francisco. Not Japan. Not Russia. Not a country that wanted my head or heart, still pulsing and ready for a man in a suit dozens of times more expensive than my life to crush like some of the synthetic fruits that had begun to flood the market.</p>
<p>Not that that man– Bratva, maybe. Yakuza? Even worse, government. Regardless, a drug lord or a trafficker with their pockets plump with blood and flesh, stained with the fluid (cerebrospinal? Seminal?) of their victim’s organs and mind and meat– would deign to feed on imitations. Perhaps, for a time, he will be Man. Man would suck the juice of real fruit off of his fingers, savoring every bite, every drop, every ounce: Man knows pain, knows it well, but pay this no mind– our Man has no empathy, no capacity for respite.</p>
<p>Man: my not quite enemy, not quite ex-lover, not quite half of anything nor three-quarters of an extant relationship. My killer, my Man, my subject of amphetamine and caffeine fueled nightmares, dreams that left me shaking and strung out in cold sobriety.</p>
<p>Boston— home? No. It was nothing. It was a train/plane/shuttle ride from nothing, and eight hours from anything that was something to my youth-drunk self— to my empty head, aching skull. The streets, regardless, a reprieve: loud. Chaotic. Full of people (vehicles for my disgust at the world, at myself, at the unalienable lust for the future that my condition provided) and stuff and things and objects. Man (terminal) infecting my system (a terminal, if I was funny), cd ego and ls flaws.</p>
<p>Nihilism, masochism, dissatisfaction: my last girlfriend deemed me those while she was somewhere approaching neural burnout, nerves being overtaken by stimulants (those same amphetamines that now powered my nightly forays into death) and the last of her cells beginning to self destruct (chemo/radiation/nanite therapy rejection, a half dozen other failed treatments that I couldn't afford tearing her apart). Damned: my soul (non denominational) in hell on Earth or not quite. Masochism– a simple affliction, symptoms include. Throwing back dex and amphetamines, wandering Boston streets in the little hours, while everyone who didn't mean to hurt me was asleep, a descent paved with (good intentions? Hell no.) neuroses and insanity.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction: I hated my body. I wish it wasn't real. Flesh betrayed and rotted, flesh was rigid and unyielding if I didn't have the cash to pay for a nameless doctor to cut my skin and muscle and bone to bits and rearrange it into a more pleasing shape– of course I didn't have that cash. I was nineteen and I didn't live in a highrise thousands of feet above the rest of us– once upon a time I was something approaching Man, on a collision course with a death (or worse, a comfortable government job) that came too fast and with too much fanfare, a life snuffed over a granule or three of cocaine.</p>
<p>Amelia: (three-syllables-not-four, 'Ame'-all-one-syllable) she told me once that I was a nihilist, and I stuck to that. Life: meaningless, a spiral, a descent. Man, Amelia, me before the fall: we controlled life, death, the descent and the climb. Losing that was my nihilism, my fall– Virgil said that it's easy to take the downward path.</p>
<p>Virgil was right.</p>
<p>Three vignettes: before.</p>
<p>On top of the world (literally, a three hundred meter up hotel room, penthouse. Figuratively, dex in my veins and two months past the deal that landed me there) and all I wanted was to climb higher, for someone to hold me and to not let me fall. Top sheets pulled off the corners, pillows kicked on the floor, half-drained bottle of wine recorked because we didn't dare waste any of it (at least that's what we told ourselves, as we shoveled pills and booze into our bodies) and you can imagine what we did the night before.</p>
<p>We had danced like we knew how in ways that people who knew how would never: falling over each other as we exchanged kisses and laughs. I rolled over– I was always on the left, she was on the right. Touched her arm. Cold. There was nothing left for her to say, and there were no tears left for me to weep. I stood up, grabbed the bottle of wine. I pushed a tablet through my lips. I drank, and I sat, and I watched.</p>
<p>Another, less morose: us, two weeks prior, in a Berlin club, more sober than we had been in years, her throwing up blood in a bathroom (I lied, our entire lives are or were nothing but morose.) Amelia killed herself: she always said that, that she killed herself dead when she first took a deal with the man I called Man. I asked her to live. She laughed.</p>
<p>A third, the most morose. A week after her. Him, offering me a cigarette and tumbler of something. Me: foolish. Nihilistic. Masochistic. He was the one who told me, kissed me on the cheek like a fucked up Judas (bad metaphor, he was the Messiah, the Roman, the traitor. I was at the table, maybe.)  He told me goodbye. He told me that he loved me. He told me that her funeral would be taken care of. He told me, he told me, he told me, he told me. (Run.) I listened.</p>
<p>Amelia is buried. I will be burned. Man shall live on. This is how the world works: glimpses of glory.</p>
