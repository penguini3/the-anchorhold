    <section><h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Howdy! My name is Jessamine, and I'm a full-time student and aspiring technical writer. I use she/her pronouns most of the time!</p>
<p>As a writer, my main interests are in topics related to mental health, dehumanization, and institutional violence. A lot of my work is inspired by the weird fiction and cyberpunk genres, along with my own experiences with the world at large and the psychiatric industry. Some of my favorite kinds of fiction is stuff that plays around with form and medium, especially when it comes to incorporating some amount of effort on behalf of the reader.</p>
<p>On the computer front, I'm a fan of retro computing and am working on teaching myself computer science stuff!! I'm majoring in IT, and am hoping to do work related to that and my writing in the future. I'm currently learning CSS, HTML, and Python, with plans for learning Rust Sometime In The Future. I already know a bit of Java and the basics of Linux system administration (Arch, btw!), but I'm far from an expert.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback related to this website, I would love to hear it!!! See <a href="../social/social">Social</a> if you want to reach out.</p>
<h2>About Her</h2>
<p>I do all of my stuff online on my laptop, a Thinkpad X13 Gen 4 running CachyOS named Madeline. She's got an AMD 7840U, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and is rocking that integrated graphics lifestyle. Sometime in the future I'd like to get an external graphics card so that I can play some more modern games, but that's an idea for when I get more money.</p>
<p>Most of my writing is done in Neovim, using either Markdown (for personal projects or stuff like this site) or LaTeX (for schoolwork). Yes, I'm a bit tooling obsessed. What about it. For a full setup tour, check out my <a href="../tech/uses">Uses</a> page!</p>
